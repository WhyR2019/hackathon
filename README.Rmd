# The challenge

Let’s find out which areas citizens of Warsaw visit most frequently! In this hackathon, we will track the behaviour of people based on the GCP data.

[Google Cloud Platform](https://cloud.google.com/) (GCP) enables 6 APIs that provide information about maps, traffic, routes or places around the globe. We decided to use GCP APIs to prepare a data set of places in Warsaw with the information about its type, address and geographical localization; where rating, number or reviews and occupancy (popular times per day) were taken from Google Search Engine!

Having such an interesting data one can immediately think about potential use cases!

- What is the best place to make a new advertisement in the city?
- What are the blank spaces on the map where a specific service is missing?
- Are the most crowded places properly equipped with a sufficient amount of city bike stations? What are the - moving/traffic trends throughout the day?
- Does the occupancy of the areas correspond to the real estate prices?

**Imagine other use cases you can invent, the moment you link the data with other sources.**

# Data

## Fishnet of Warsaw (WGS84)

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/WhyR2019/hackathon/master/plots/warsaw_05_wgs84.png)

To call [GCP Places API](https://developers.google.com/places/web-service/details) we used
a fishnet of Warsaw in WSG84 system. The fishnet we generated present grid of Warsaw after every 500 metres.
For each point we called [GCP Places API](https://developers.google.com/places/web-service/details) to get all
places of a specific [type]((https://developers.google.com/places/web-service/supported_types#table1)) within a range of
`floor(500*sqrt(2)/2)` (~353) metres. Based on all 2058 points, we were able to extract all available
places of a specific type in Warsaw.

Since [GCP Places API](https://developers.google.com/places/web-service/details) is a paid platform, on a limit allowed for NGOs for free, we were able just to download few types of places. Below you can find types that we are planning to extract, displayed in the order of priority

- restaurants
- local_government_office
- supermarket
- movie_theater
- gas_station
- gym
- post_office
- cafe
- night_club
- pharmacy
- city_hall
- police
- dentist
- doctor
- school
- furniture_store
- hospital
- veterinary_care

## Hackathon data

> Full data will be annouanced a day before the event.

You can find the example data to understand the structure of collected information in the [data/](https://github.com/WhyR2019/hackathon/tree/master/data) directory. Before we annouance the full data, you can find there

- amrit.csv
    - example based on 7 Amrit Oriental Foods restaurants around Warsaw
    - [GCP Places API](https://developers.google.com/places/web-service/details) allows to extract
        - place_id (GCP realted id of the place)
        - name (place name)
        - user_ratings_total (number of ratings)
        - rating (the average rating)
        - types ([types of places](https://developers.google.com/places/web-service/supported_types#table1) the place is assigned to)
        - price_level (the level of prices)
            - 0 — Free
            - 1 — Inexpensive
            - 2 — Moderate
            - 3 — Expensive
            - 4 — Very Expensive
        - vicinity (a simplified address for the place)
        - lat (latitude of the place in WGS84 *system*)
        - lng (longitude of the place in WGS84 *system*)

```{r, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(readr)
amrit <- read_csv("data/amrit.csv")
knitr::kable(amrit)
```

- amrit_popular_times.csv
    - example based on 7 Amrit Oriental Foods restaurants around Warsaw
    - Google Search allows to extract
        - the day of week
        - the hour of the day
        - the occupancy index
        - the occupancy text
        - av_time_spent (average time spent in the place)
        - place_id, name and vicinity to join with [GCP Places API](https://developers.google.com/places/web-service/details) data
        
```{r, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
amrit_popular_times <- read_csv("data/amrit_popular_times.csv")
knitr::kable(head(amrit_popular_times))
```
