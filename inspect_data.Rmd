```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## Inspection on data

```{r include=FALSE}

library(tidyverse)
library(inspectdf)

load('data/200_raw_data_places.Rdata')
```


### Counting of NA's

```{r}

inspect_na(raw_data_places) %>% show_plot()
#inspect_na(raw_data_popular_times) %>% show_plot()

```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
